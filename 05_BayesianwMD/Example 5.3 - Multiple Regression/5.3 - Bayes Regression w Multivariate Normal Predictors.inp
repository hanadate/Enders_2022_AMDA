TITLE: 
example 5.4: bayes regression with multivariate normal predictors;
DATA: 
file = employee.dat;
VARIABLE: 
names = employee team turnover male empower lmx worksat climate cohesion;
usevariables = empower lmx climate male;
missing = all(999);
ANALYSIS:
estimator = bayes;
fbiterations = 10000;

MODEL:
! normal distribution for predictors;
lmx climate male;
! label slope coefficients in focal model;
empower on lmx (b1)
	climate (b2)
	male (b3);
MODEL TEST:
! wald test that all slopes equal 0;
0 = b1;
0 = b2;
0 = b3;
OUTPUT:
